    <h1>To Ridima Basnet,</h1>
    <p>I don’t even know where to begin, because you’ve always been more than just a name to me. Your smile, your way of speaking, the way you treat everyone with equal respect — that’s what stuck with me since school. You didn’t even have to try. You just <em>were</em> — effortlessly kind, beautiful, and real.</p>
    <p>And then came the part that hit different.<br />You chose someone 10 years older than you.<br />And you know what?<br /><strong>F**k that choice.</strong></p>
    <p>It’s not jealousy. It’s not ego. It’s the sting of watching someone you admire deeply choose something that feels miles away from what <em>we</em> shared — or what I thought we could have shared. Maybe it never mattered to you like it did to me. But if you ever wondered, yeah, it mattered. A lot.</p>
    <p>This letter isn’t just about love. It’s about saying what I never could. You were someone I truly respected, and maybe that’s why it hurts. You deserve everything good in life — I just wish I was part of the version you dreamed up.</p>
    <p class="signature">— Someone who still thinks about your smile</p>
